# About project
Baruco is an app prepared for [Baruco 2012](http://www.baruco.org) in Barcelona

We decided to release source code so people can check what's inside the app.

Code is wiped out of fragile data (like api endpoints). Working version of app you can download [here](https://itunes.apple.com/pl/app/baruco/id556911206?mt=8)
